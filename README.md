# Tremendouscoin Solo Mining

Tremendouscoin (https://github.com/tremendouscoin/tremendouscoin) 
is an extremely experimental and not yet serious (as of 19 Jan 2018) cryptocurrency.
Below, let's work on figuring out how to solo mine it.

## Credits

This code and documentation is forked from 
https://github.com/mikeghen/litecoin-solo-mining-tutorial

I do not know that author at all, but his tutorial seems pretty great and it is
based on litecoin 0.14 so it seemed like the best way to work on solo mining Tremendouscoin.
Additional info is available at that repo.

## Tremendouscoin-specific Cheat Sheet

Get tremendouscoind up and running on an AWS server as per
https://github.com/tremendouscoin/tremendouscoin

Once that's going try running:

```
tremendouscoin-cli getinfo
```

...etc etc etc basically as per following the patterns in https://github.com/mikeghen/litecoin-solo-mining-tutorial

Not working yet, but seems promising!!!
